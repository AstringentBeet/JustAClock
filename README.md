## Overview
This is a simple clock made with a variety of technologies.
There isn't an end goal in sight, but this serves more as a way for me to better understand
how to functionally use Javascript and it's respective frameworks/libraries.

The plan as of now is to create an aesthetically pleasing clock that has a few themes that the user
can change (Flip clock, analog, and vintage). Some may feature some characters from Haruki Murakami's
'Kafka on The Shore', but I'll do so once I get a solid understanding of CSS and JS animation.


## The Process


### Built With

All versions will include the basics of HTML CSS and Javascript. Becuase this will primarily
be a graphic-based application, this will not be an HTML, let alone a semantically heavy project.

- The initial versions will feature use of CSS flexbox and grid, but will be manipulated primarily by:
- Javascript is the sole purpose of this project. There won't be much work going on in the back-end since
this will be more of a UI demo, but this may change depending on what ideas come along the way.

### What I Learned

- basic ajax
- CSS Flexbox

### Resources

Trust me, bro.

## Progress Log

#### 03/25/2022
Created the skeleton of the app.

#### 03/28/2022
Rearranged some files and added async Javascript to the webpage. As of now, the interval is set to refresh every second, but not to t noticeable degree. The next step is to add in the fade-in introduction, followed by the typed out clock. If I'm feeling confident enough, I'll add a different theme to the demo.
